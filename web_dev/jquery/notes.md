Jquery : Plan of attack
  - see if there are any useful overview videos on youtube
  - take a 4 breaks every halfhour for 5 minutes
  - each halfhour try to recap something I learned
  - read/skim JavaScript/jQuery book I bought
    -code along in any useful points of this book to try and help me remember the material.
  - I also plan on taking some notes.
