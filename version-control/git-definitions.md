# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the ability to write code off of the master branch and then take that version and merge it onto the master branch. It allows numerous developers to work on the same project and and write different parts of versions of the same project. Then they can put it all together when ready.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is created off of the master branch and is basically a place that lets you work without having to change the master branch until you are ready.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a save point on your code. After you added or changed something that you want to remember or merge with the master branch you can make a commit and updates that version on whichever branch you are on. A good commit message is detailed on what was done and what was changed.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when the changes and code made on one of the feature branches is merged with the master and something in the code won't work with the code already on the master branch. It 'conflicts' so it won't let you merge it until it is fixed.
